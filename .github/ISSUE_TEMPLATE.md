# Pre issue-raising checklist

I have already (please mark the applicable with an `x`):

* [ ] Read through the relevant docs at https://docs.pact.io
* [ ] Upgraded to the latest version of the gem
* [ ] Checked the CHANGELOG to see if the issue I am about to raise has been fixed
* [ ] Created an executable example that demonstrates the issue using either a:
  * Dockerfile
  * Git repository with a Travis or Appveyor (or similar) build

## Software versions

* **OS**: e.g. Mac OSX 10.11.5
* **pact mock service:** eg. v 1.23.0

## Expected behaviour

## Steps to reproduce
